# 📜 ADCS Active Directory Certificate Services:

Certificate Services, a service running on a Windows server operating system, receives requests for new digital certificates over transports such as RPC or HTTP. It checks each request against custom or site-specific policies, sets optional properties for a certificate to be issued, and issues the certificate. Certificate Services allows administrators to add elements to a certificate revocation list (CRL), and to publish signed CRLs on a regular basis.
Certificate services include programmable interfaces for creating support for additional transports, policies, and certificate properties and formats.
In Windows Server 2003, Certificate Services 2.0 can be installed from Control Panel by clicking Add or Remove Programs and then clicking Add/Remove Windows Components to install or uninstall Certificate Services.
